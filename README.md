# Project Statement

The title of this project is Fire Operation Support Application. This application expands the legacy system and can monitor currently active firefighting vehicles and personnel, and direct operations at the dispatch unit level. The purpose of this project is to collect integrated information for smooth operation and provide visualized information to users.

This project assumes the existence of a legacy system. The legacy systems include receiving a 911 call, issuing a dispatch order to a fire station near the accident site, and dispatching a fire truck. Assume that the location of the fire vehicle can be received as streaming data through the fire vehicle's GPS terminal.
The scope of the project is as follows: It receives disaster information and fire vehicle dummy GPS information via streaming and displays the real-time location of fire vehicles on the map. The command center in charge of operations can view information on active firefighting resources and resources on standby and request additional resources.
